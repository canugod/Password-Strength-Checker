# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple password strength checker implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works

The tool evaluates the strength of a password based on the following criteria:
- Weak: Only lowercase letters (6 or less characters)
- Medium: Lowercase + Uppercase (6-12 characters)
- Strong: Includes uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters (12+ characters)
